                    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my
                        name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                        outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
                        what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here
                        shopping for an infant named Jeb.
                        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses
                        differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and
                        I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
                        we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just
                        on opposite ends.
                        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
                        that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if
                        they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
                        don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it
                        killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to
                        climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us
                        survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We
                        said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it
                        doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
